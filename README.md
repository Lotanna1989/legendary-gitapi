# legendary-gitapi
An app that fetches my github repos using a github api intgefrated to the app. when it is clicked u can see my repos and when the repos are clicked u can see further info. It also catches error if there is an issues with network or mistyped address or an error, it will display error message or 404 error. Enjoy my app. Thanks
